## Invisible Cloak Project

# Overview
This is a computer vision project that creates an "invisible cloak" effect using OpenCV and Python. Inspired by the invisibility cloak from Harry Potter, this script uses color-based segmentation to make specific colored objects "disappear" from the video stream.
Features

# Real-time invisibility effect
Customizable color detection
Works with different camera setups

# Prerequisites

Python 3.7+
OpenCV
NumPy


# Tips

Move out of the frame when capturing the background
Use a blue cloth/object for the invisibility effect
Press 'q' to quit the application

# Customization
You can adjust color ranges in the script:
pythonCopy# Example color range for blue
